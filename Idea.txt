My buddy wants to launch his own record label, as well
as resell records through the same website. I figure
I will create an api and frontend for that end and kill
two birds with one stone. The site will be feature complete with
the ability for admins to add records to the database, sorting and searching by label,
genre, year, etc. And I will attempt to implement square into it as well
for the purpose of buying said records.
